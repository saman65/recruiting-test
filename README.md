#Purpose of the Code:

The index.php file represents the main page of a web application. It includes HTML, CSS, and PHP code to display a "Hello World!" message, retrieve and display comments from a database and beer information form a webserver through REST, and provide a form for users to submit new comments. The page also includes pagination functionality to navigate through the comments.

The code performs the following tasks:

Display a "Hello World!" message along with server time and client IP address.
Retrieve comments from the database and display them in a formatted manner.
Display a success message if a comment was successfully submitted.
Provide pagination links to navigate through the comments.
Display a form to allow users to submit new comments.
Now let's document the functions in the code.

##Functions:

There are two functions being used, which we can document:

getPunkAPIInfo($beername) - This function is used to retrieve information from the Punk API based on the provided beer name.

anonymizeUsername($username) - This function is used to anonymize the provided username.

###Deployment:

To deploy and operate the code, follow these steps:

Copy all the files to the appropriate location on your web server.

Ensure that you have a compatible version of PHP installed on the server.

Create a MySQL database and import the required database structure using the provided SQL script (not included in the provided code). Update the database connection details in the db.php file.

Make sure the necessary CSS and JavaScript files are present in the specified locations (css/bootstrap.min.css, css/style.css, js/script.js).

Ensure that the web server has the necessary permissions to read and write files and folders as required by the application.

Access the index.php file through a web browser to view and interact with the application.

####functions.php

This file contains two functions used in the PHP project.

getPunkAPIInfo($beername)
This function retrieves information from the Punk API based on the provided beer name.
Parameters:
$beername (string): The name of the beer to search for.
Return Value:
An associative array containing the beer's image URL and ID if found.
Returns null if no data is available.

anonymizeUsername($username)
This function anonymizes the provided username.
Parameters:
$username (string): The username to anonymize.
Return Value:
The anonymized username, where the first name is shortened to its first three letters followed by 'x' characters, and the last name is represented by its first letter followed by a dot.
If the last name is not provided, only the anonymized first name is returned.
Please note that the implementation details for these functions are provided in the code. Ensure that the Punk API is accessible and the necessary PHP functions (e.g., file_get_contents) are enabled for the getPunkAPIInfo() function to work correctly. Additionally, verify that the anonymizeUsername() function fulfills the desired anonymization requirements for your project.

#####JavaScript Code

The JavaScript code snippet provided performs the following tasks:

servereTime()
This function fetches the server's UTC time using the ISO-8601 format.
The server time is displayed in an element with the ID "server-time".
The function is executed repeatedly every 1 millisecond using the setInterval function.
Fetching the Client IP Address

The client IP address is fetched from an API using the fetch function.
The API used is "https://api.ipify.org?format=json".
The fetched IP address is displayed in an element with the ID "client-ip".

validateForm()
This function is used to validate the username input in a form.
It retrieves the value of the "username" field from the form.
It uses a regular expression (/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/) to match only alphanumeric characters.
If the username contains any non-alphanumeric characters, an alert is shown, and the function returns false to prevent form submission.
